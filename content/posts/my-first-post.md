Hello everyone and welcome to the one and only **DYNOBLOG!**

**Home to all updates to my game, apps i'm working on, or general life posts; It's all here!**

To kick things off I'll share a little bit about how this website was made, specifically speaking I used [GoHugo](https://gohugo.io) and [PaperMod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/) along with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting.

It was such a simple and easy process **I actually finished everything and got it up in running about 30 minuets before work.**

If you want to ask me about it you can feel free to reach out at my email:
**[dyno@dynopunch.com](dyno@dynopunch.com)**.

Anyway, thank you for your time. until next time!
